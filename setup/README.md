<br />
<p>
  The setup folder (former .wizard folder) is the main folder to make changes for the custom-template npm run setup command. in the lib folder you can find the template generating file. Under the templates folder you can find the frameworks, assets, components, styles and the graphql.config. Under setup/templates/javascript/api, you can find all the files you need for the backend. Under tests you can find the files that are needed to run the test command.

<p>After making your changes don't forget to run tsc to compile the setup folder into the dist folder!</p>
